            Quick guide to the Ramayana
            Background
            The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic which follows Prince Rama's quest to<br>
             rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches<br>
            of Ravana with the help of an army of monkeys. It is traditionally attributed<br>
             to the authorship of the sage Valmiki and dated<br>
            to around 500 BCE to 100 BCE.<br>

            Comprising 24,000 verses in seven cantos, the epic contains the teachings of <br>
            the very ancient Hindu sages. One of the most <br>
            important literary works of ancient India, it has greatly influenced art and <br>
            culture in the Indian subcontinent and South <br>
            East Asia, with versions of the story also appearing in the Buddhist canon from<br>
             a very early date. The story of Rama has <br>
            constantly been retold in poetic and dramatic versions by some of India's<br>
             greatest writers and also in narrative sculptures<br>
            on temple walls. It is one of the staples of later dramatic traditions, <br>
            re-enacted in dance-dramas, village theatre, shadow-<br>
            puppet theatre and the annual Ram-lila (Rama-play).

            Origins
            The original five books of an oral epic of local northern significance dealing<br>
             with a hero and his exile, the abduction of<br>
            his wife by a rival king and her rescue became conflated into seven books in <br>
            which the hero Rama became an avatar of the god<br>
            Vishnu, the scene shifted to encompass the whole of India, and the struggle to<br>
             recover his wife became a metaphor for the<br>
            final triumph of the righteous.<br>

            After the crash, he vanished. Some say he moved to a compound in Africa,some <br>
            say he went off the grid.
            But the Silicon Valley genius who engineered the greatest<br>
            stockmarket disaster in history is hiding in plain sight<br>
